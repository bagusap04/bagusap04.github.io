     ```
     git clone https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git
     ```

3. **Add Project Files**: 
   - Copy the contents of this project into your cloned repository.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**: 
   - Navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main
     ```

5. **Access Your Website**:
